# Simple Flight Booking Model

This code is a lab assignment for an object oriented design class.

This code implements a simple model of a flight booking system. It utilizes different types of classes and is meant as an
exercise in the basics of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.

Flight objects represent flights and passengers are members of a frequent flyer program or a non-member.
If a seat is available on a flight the cost of the ticket will depend on the member status of the passenger.

There is a list of recommended inputs that will demonstrate the use of projects classes and methods. 
The code will still work with alternative inputs, but the hardcoded sections in the main() class are best showcased with recommended inputs.
