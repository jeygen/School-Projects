When running ./heap the file input.txt can be used for the input values. ie "./heap < input.txt"

The program will also accept manual integer values. It will crash if non-integers are input.

The output will be the input values, an array in heap form, xml nodes presented in a preorder traversal, sorted
descending values via deleting from the heap, and then finally ascending values from a stack.
